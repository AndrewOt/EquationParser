# EquationParser
A project to parse functions and non-functions of one and two variables. 
The output will be a table with x, y, and z being columns and the rows the values computed. 
Inputs include an equation (string) and start, stop, and step numbers.   

Plan: 
1) parse (aka calculate f(x) for a given set/domain X) functions of one variable effectively (including oder of operations) 
2) parse functions of two variables 
3) write unit tests 
4) test some more and optimize  

The goal is to make this a robust complied api to be used in other programs.
